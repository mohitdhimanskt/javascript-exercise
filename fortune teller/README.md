Be your own fortune teller

Why pay a fortune teller when you can just program your fortune yourself?

    Write a function named tellFortune.

    It takes 4 arguments: number of children (number), partner's name (string), geographic location (string), job title (string).
    Randomly select values from the arrays.
    Return a string: "You will be a [JOB_TITLE] in [LOCATION], and married to [PARTNER_NAME] with [NUMBER_KIDS] kids."

    Create 4 arrays, numChildren, partnerNames, locations and jobs. Give each array 5 random values that make sense
    Call the function 1 time, by passing the arrays as the argument.
