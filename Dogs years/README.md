You know how old your dog is in human years, but what about dog years? Calculate it!

    Write a function named calculateDogAge.

    It takes 1 argument: your puppy's age (number).
    Calculate your dog's age based on the conversion rate of 1 human year to 7 dog years.
    Return a string: "Your doggie is [CALCULATED_VALUE] years old in dog years!"

    Call the function three times with different sets of values.
